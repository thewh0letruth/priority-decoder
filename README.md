# Priority Decoder

## Purpose
Priority Decoder is a **single-page HTML web app** designed to help users quickly classify work items as "Real Priority," "Schedulable," "Delegatable," or "Noise." It aims to reduce cognitive load rather than promote productivity theater. The app is lightweight and works seamlessly in **standalone mode** when added to the Home Screen (iOS Safari).

## Philosophy
- Loud ≠ Important
- Done > Perfect
- Calm beats urgency

The app exists to help the user slow down and think clearly.

## Quick Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thewh0letruth/priority-decoder.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a mobile Safari browser.

3. Add to your Home Screen via Safari’s “Add to Home Screen” option.

## Features
- **Standalone mode**: No Safari UI distractions.
- **Custom icon and splash image**: Designed for iPhone 16 Pro.
- **Minimal interactions**: Button-driven navigation with no keyboard input required.
